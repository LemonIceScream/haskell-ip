{-| An IPv4 data type

    This module provides the IPv4 data type and functions for working
    with it. There are also encoding and decoding functions provided
    in this module, but they should be imported from
    @Net.IPv4.Text@ and @Net.IPv4.ByteString.Char8@ instead. They are
    defined here so that the 'FromJSON' and 'ToJSON' instances can
    use them.

    At some point, a highly efficient IPv4-to-ByteString function needs
    to be added to this module to take advantage of @aeson@'s new
    @toEncoding@ method.

-- | Create an 'IPv4' address from four octets. The first argument
--   is the most significant octet. The last argument is the least

--   Since the 'Show' and 'Read' instances for 'IPv4' are not generally
--   usefully, this function is the recommened way to create 'IPv4' addresses.
--   For example:
--
--   >>> fromOctets 192 168 1 1
--   IPv4 {getIPv4 = 3232235777}
